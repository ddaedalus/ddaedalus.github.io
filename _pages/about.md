## About me

I am a PhD candidate enrolled jointly at the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) of the [National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) and [Archimedes AI](https://archimedesai.gr/en/), where I am very fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Ioannis Panageas](https://panageas.github.io/) ([GOAL-Lab](https://goallabuci.github.io/), UC Irvine) and [Prof. Aris Pagourtzis](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/staff/79) ([CoReLab](https://corelab.ntua.gr/index.html), NTUA).  

Prior to pursuing my PhD, I obtained an [M.Sc. in Data Science and Machine Learning](https://dsml.ece.ntua.gr/en), as well as a joint [B.Sc.-M.Eng. degree in ECE](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/undergraduate/info) with a major in Computer Science, all from NTUA. During my master's studies, I worked as an Applied Scientist intern (Level 4) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) in Barcelona. Before my time at Amazon, I was a research assistant at the [AI Lab](http://datacron1.ds.unipi.gr:9083/ai-lab/) of the [University of Piraeus](https://www.unipi.gr/unipi/en/), working under the mentorship of [Prof. George A. Vouros](http://datacron1.ds.unipi.gr:9083/ai-lab/george-vouros/), and a research assistant at the Institute of Informatics & Telecommunications ([IIT](https://www.iit.demokritos.gr/el/about-the-institute/)) of [NCSR Demokritos](https://www.demokritos.gr/).

Here are my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?hl=en&user=nBFso2IAAAAJ) and [dblp](https://dblp.org/pid/309/6039.html) profiles. My updated CV can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ptZrWxJjxShFi62Lxhz86tlT9FTtOX3X/view?usp=sharing">here (PDF)</a>.

## Research Interests

In general, I am interested in the intersection of game theory, online learning and reinforcement learning. Current areas of interest include: 
* Computing/Learning equilibria in games (e.g., Markov games, polyhedral games)
* No-regret learning with combinatorial structure (e.g., contextual/linear/combinatorial bandits)
* The computational complexity of hard problems in game theory and optimization
* Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) under partial observability (e.g., agent/state modelling)

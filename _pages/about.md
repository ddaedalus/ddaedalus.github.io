## About me

I am a PhD candidate jointly at the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) of the [National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) and [Archimedes Research Unit](https://archimedesai.gr/en/), where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ioannis Panageas](https://panageas.github.io/) (UC Irvine) and [Prof. Aris Pagourtzis](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/staff/79) (NTUA, [CoReLab](https://corelab.ntua.gr/index.html)). Previously, I obtained an [M.Sc. in Data Science and Machine Learning](https://dsml.ece.ntua.gr/en) and a joint [B.Sc.-M.Eng. degree in ECE](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/undergraduate/info) - with major in Computer Science - all from NTUA. Concurrently to my master studies, I had been an Applied Scientist intern (Level 4) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) in Barcelona and prior to that a research assistant at the [Institute of Informatics & Telecommunications](https://www.iit.demokritos.gr/el/about-the-institute/) of [NCSR Demokritos](https://www.demokritos.gr/).

Here are my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?hl=en&user=nBFso2IAAAAJ), [dblp](https://dblp.org/pid/309/6039.html) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreas-kontogiannis-2405a3176/) profiles. My Curriculum Vitae (CV) can be found [here](https://github.com/ddaedalus/ddaedalus.github.io/blob/master/files/cv_kontogiannis_andreas_.pdf).

## Research Interests

In general, I am interested in the following research areas: 
* The intersection of theoretical reinforcement learning (RL), optimization and game theory
* The computational complexity of optimization problems
* Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Deep MARL) focused on agent modelling, coordinated exploration, safety and relative overgeneralization

## Academic Service
* Reviewing: ICLR 2024

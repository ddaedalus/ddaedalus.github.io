## About me

I am a PhD candidate enrolled jointly at the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) of the [National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) and [Archimedes Research Unit](https://archimedesai.gr/en/), where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ioannis Panageas](https://panageas.github.io/) ([UC Irvine](https://cs.ics.uci.edu/)) and [Prof. Aris Pagourtzis](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/staff/79) ([CoReLab](https://corelab.ntua.gr/index.html), NTUA). Additionally, I have been a research collaborator at the [AI Lab](http://datacron1.ds.unipi.gr:9083/ai-lab/) of the [University of Piraeus](https://www.unipi.gr/unipi/en/), working under the mentorship of [Prof. George A. Vouros](http://datacron1.ds.unipi.gr:9083/ai-lab/george-vouros/). 

Prior to pursuing my PhD, I obtained an [M.Sc. in Data Science and Machine Learning](https://dsml.ece.ntua.gr/en), as well as a joint [B.Sc.-M.Eng. degree in ECE](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/undergraduate/info) with a major in Computer Science, all from NTUA. During my master's studies, I worked as an Applied Scientist intern (Level 4) at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) in Barcelona. Before my time at Amazon, I was a research assistant at the Institute of Informatics & Telecommunications ([IIT](https://www.iit.demokritos.gr/el/about-the-institute/)) of [NCSR Demokritos](https://www.demokritos.gr/).

Here are my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?hl=en&user=nBFso2IAAAAJ) and [dblp](https://dblp.org/pid/309/6039.html) and profiles. My updated CV can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ptZrWxJjxShFi62Lxhz86tlT9FTtOX3X/view?usp=sharing">here (PDF)</a>.

## Research Interests

In general, I am interested in the following research areas: 
* The intersection of theoretical reinforcement learning (RL), optimization and game theory
* The computational complexity of optimization problems
* Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) focused on agent modelling, coordinated exploration, safety and relative overgeneralization

## Academic Service
* Reviewing: **ICML** (2024), **ICLR** (2024)
